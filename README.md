# MVP for Group 17


Team Name: Group 17
Team Members (NetIDs): atran63, madhav4, vincel2, majani2, nk4
Team PM (NetIDs): somyas3

Name your MVP “Group ___ MVP.”  You are allowed to use bullet points!

### What problem is your project trying to solve?  
(What audience is it for? How will your project solve the issue?) - (Anakin, Natasha, Maharsh)
⇒ Our project solves the problem of quickly digitizing printed documents or photos of texts by recognizing text from images, which allows for easier storage and access to information quickly by harnessing the power of Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

The improved accessibility that an OCR project brings can benefit a wide audience, including data analysts looking to automate data entry, historians who take information from written sources, and everyday people who want to digitize personal documents for safekeeping or convenience.

### What features make up your MVP (Minimum Viable Product)? 
(What features do you hope to accomplish by the end of the semester?) - (Natasha, Sarayu)
⇒ Our project will be able to recognize text that is printed or hand written  in  English. First, it will be able to recognize letters, then individual words, and finally a sentence. 

### What are some additional features outside the MVP? 
(A list of features that would be nice to add after finishing the MVP.)
⇒ Perhaps a front-end for the neural network that allows a user interface to sketch a character and the neural network gives an output

### Which does the tech stack look like and why did you choose these over alternatives? 
(Feel free to discuss this with your PM! Examples: React, Python, Java, etc. You do not need to know how to use these right now.) (Madhav, Vince)
⇒ We choose Python as the main programming language to develop our neural network. Python is arguably one of the most famous programming languages for data analysis. It has a wide range of supported libraries that make tasks like visualizing data, implementing certain machine learning models, and conducting various forms of mathematical analysis trivial. Furthermore, everyone in our group has at least a foundational understanding of the Python syntax which makes it a no-brainer. Finally, python has well-established affiliated software that makes machine learning implementation and collaboration easier like Jupyter Notebooks and Google CoLabs

We will be using the following libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn, scipy pytorch, and possibly seaborn.
Numpy and pandas are used for mathematical calculations regarding the foundation of the neural network.
Sklearn is used for simple structures of convolution and pooling areas. Pytorch will be the foundation for our first implementation of the neural network. After that, we may scale with tensor flow or keras.
We will also be using the Jupyter Notebook extension in VSCode as the integrated terminal allows for code to be pushed to Github far more easily.



### What will the project timeline look like?
(Discuss this with your PM as well! You don’t have to stick to it, but this should give you a general guideline for how the project should progress.)
(Armaan)
⇒ Week 1 and 2, meet and discuss topics: choose neural networks to distinguish text from images. In the following weeks,  research neural networks and continue with the shared Github/ VScode environment. Install necessary libraries and set up a basic framework/template for the network. Over the next few weeks train algorithms with relevant text that can be provided. Weeks 6 - 10 Continue tuning algorithms for the following weeks  - should take the bulk of the time. Modify the model to handle handwritten text recognition. Focus on refining the model to handle cases that might mess with results, along with analyzing the model and testing the final steps. Look into the front end on weeks 13-14, and integrate with the model. Perform final tests and prepare to combine both parts. Last few weeks, published and documented information regarding the neural network.
